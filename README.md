# Earthquake Visualization Project

Welcome to the Earthquake Visualization Project! This project involves visualizing earthquake data using HTML, JavaScript, and Leaflet. In this project, we will create a dynamic map that displays earthquake data obtained from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) GeoJSON feed. This earthquake visualization project can appeal to a wide range of people, from students and web developers to geology enthusiasts and safety-conscious individuals. It offers an educational and practical opportunity to learn more about earthquakes and how to visualize geospatial data in an interactive web environment.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the earthquake visualization.
3. Explore the map, click on earthquake markers to view additional information, and interact with any implemented layer controls.

## Project Instructions
I created the Earthquake Visualization as part of the project. Here's what I did:

1. **Got the Dataset**: I visited the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and chose a dataset to visualize. Specifically, I selected "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days."
2. **Imported and Visualized Data**: I used the URL of the JSON representation of the selected earthquake dataset to import the data into my project.
3. **Created a Map**: I utilized the Leaflet JavaScript library to create a map that plotted all the earthquakes from my dataset based on their longitude and latitude coordinates.
4. **Customized Data Markers**: I customized the data markers on the map to reflect the magnitude of each earthquake through their size and the depth of each earthquake through color. I ensured that earthquakes with higher magnitudes appeared larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appeared darker in color.
5. **Added Popups**: I included popups that provided additional information about each earthquake when its associated marker was clicked.
6. **Created a Legend**: I designed a legend that provided context for the map data, explaining the relationship between marker size and earthquake magnitude, as well as marker color and earthquake depth.

Enjoy visualizing earthquake data and exploring seismic activity on your interactive map! If you have any questions or encounter issues, please refer to the readme or reach out to the project maintainers for assistance
