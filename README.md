# Earthquake Visualization Project

Welcome to the Earthquake Visualization Project! This project involves visualizing earthquake data using HTML, JavaScript, and Leaflet. In this project, we will create a dynamic map that displays earthquake data obtained from the USGS (United States Geological Survey) GeoJSON feed.

## Project Instructions
### Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization
Your first task is to create a visualization of earthquake data. Follow these steps to complete this part of the project:

1. Get Your Dataset: Visit the USGS GeoJSON Feed page and choose a dataset to visualize. For example, you can select "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days."
2. Import and Visualize Data: Use the URL of the JSON representation of the selected earthquake dataset to import the data into your project.
3. Create a Map: Utilizing the Leaflet JavaScript library, create a map that plots all the earthquakes from your dataset based on their longitude and latitude coordinates.
4. Customize Data Markers: Customize the data markers on your map to reflect the magnitude of each earthquake through their size and the depth of each earthquake through color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
5. Add Popups: Include popups that provide additional information about each earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.
6. Create a Legend: Design a legend that provides context for the map data, explaining the relationship between marker size and earthquake magnitude, as well as marker color and earthquake depth.

Your earthquake visualization should resemble the sample map provided in the project instructions.

Part 2: Gather and Plot More Data (Optional)
In this optional part of the project, you can challenge yourself by plotting a second dataset that illustrates the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Follow these steps:

Plot Tectonic Plates Data: Pull in the tectonic plates dataset from https://github.com/fraxen/tectonicplates and display it on your map alongside the earthquake data.

Add Base Maps: Incorporate additional base maps that users can choose from to enhance the map's context.

Overlay Management: Organize the earthquake and tectonic plates datasets into separate overlays that users can turn on and off independently.

Layer Controls: Implement layer controls on your map, allowing users to toggle between different datasets and base maps.

Requirements
The following requirements apply to "Part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization." "Part 2" is optional and does not earn extra points:

Your project should include HTML, JavaScript, and Leaflet files to create the earthquake visualization.
How to Run the Project
Clone this repository to your local machine.

Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the earthquake visualization.

Explore the map, click on earthquake markers to view additional information, and interact with any implemented layer controls.

Feel free to challenge yourself by completing "Part 2" as an extension of this project.

Enjoy visualizing earthquake data and exploring seismic activity on your interactive map! If you have any questions or encounter issues, please refer to the readme or reach out to the project maintainers for assistance
